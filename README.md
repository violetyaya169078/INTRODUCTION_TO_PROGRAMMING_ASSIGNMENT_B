IFN555 Introduction To Programming Assignment B (QUT, SemesterA, 2022)

--*Programmed in C#*--

Queensland State hosts the Queensland Idol competition each summer during the State fair. The talent competition takes place over a three-day period during which contestants are eliminated following rounds of performances until the year’s ultimate winner is chosen. Write a program named QueenslandRevenue that performs the following five tasks. 
1.	Displaying the competition’s motto, which is “The Stars shine in Queensland”. 
Make the motto surrounded by a border composed of asterisks. 	

2.	Prompting the user for the number of contestants who entered in last year’s competition, and this year’s competition.  The user must enter a number between 0 and 30, inclusive, for the number of contestants for each year. If the user enters a number outside this range, the program must prompt for a value within the range.						

3.	Displaying all the input data, compute and display the revenue expected for this year’s competition if each contestant pays a $25 entrance fee. 			

4.	Displaying a statement that compares the number of contestants for each year. 

*	If the competition has more than twice as many contestants as last year, display “The competition is more than twice as big this year!”
*	If the competition is bigger than last year’s but not more than twice as big, display “The competition is bigger than ever!”
*	If the competition is smaller than or equal to last year’s, display “A tighter race this year! Come out and cast your vote!”
	
5.	After the user enters the number of contestants in this year’s competition, the user is prompted to enter the appropriate number of contestant names and a code for each contestant that indicates the type of talent: S for singing, D for dancing, M for playing musical instrument, or O for other. Make sure that all entered codes are valid (S, D, M or O), and if not, re-prompt the user to enter the correct code. After the data entry for the contestant is complete, display a count of each type of talent. Then, continuously prompt the user for a talent code until the user enters a sentinel value. For each code entry, display a list of the contestants with that code, or display a message that the code is not valid and re-prompt the user for a valid code.
